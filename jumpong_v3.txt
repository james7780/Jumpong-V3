JumPong V3 for Atari 5200
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By James Higgs 2023

Here is a simple version of Pong, written for the Atari 5200 using cc65.

It's converted from the 5200Basic version (Jumpong V2), which was written in 2003. This in turn was an upgraded version of the original JumPong I wrote using DASM 6502 assembler in 2002.

It's still closer to a demo than a full game.

Use the * and # keys on the 5200 controller to choose between joystick and paddle control.

NOT TESTED ON A REAL 5200!

The source code is included in case you want to fix any bugs, get it running on a real 5200, or improve it. If you do, please notify me.

Have fun!

POSSIBLE FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS:
- Player can put some spin on the ball
- "crumbling" bat when you lose a point
- Better sound effects
